# vimeo-scraper
Video scraper made with scrapy (made for Vimeo videos)

Work in progress: As of now, you can download public videos (To be tested).

Make sure you have Python3 (tested with 3.7.3) and the libraries used in the program, then in the terminal type:

   `python3 vimeoScraper.py url_of_the_video`
   
   If the video or playlist is password protected, just put the password after the URL: 
   
   `python3 vimeoScraper.py url_of_the_video password`
